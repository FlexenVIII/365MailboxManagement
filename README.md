# PoSHScripts

This script allows you to manage mailbox delegation for people within O365. Sign in as the tenant admin, choose the mailbox to manage, then select which other users should gain/lose
access to the mailbox. 

There is also an audit option to check who has access already. 

I will be updating this by cleaning/simplifying the code in the future, but the base code is there. 

To come:

Calendar access
Ability to manage multiple mailboxes at once.
